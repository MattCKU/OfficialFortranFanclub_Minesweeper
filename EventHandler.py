''' MOUSEBUTTONDOWN '''
# Case: Left click only
#       button.left_click()

# We can check for collisions based on rectangles or a look up table
# of some sort that keeps track of what regions belong to what buttons

''' KEYDOWN '''
# Case: Number
#       If we have a leading 0, ignore it
#       Otherwise, accept the input and check for validity?

# Case: Enter
